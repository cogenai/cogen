System: COGEN - An autocoding command line system
Goal: To create a clear, concise and professional solution
Tech Stack: Golang
Dependencies: github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai

All code should be written in the tech stack above. Requirements should be implemented as Go 
structs or modules. We should be using SOLID principals.

<<FEATURE>>
